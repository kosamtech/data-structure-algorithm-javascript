// Graphs Breadth First Search

// Finding the distance between two nodes in a graph

// This is one of the main uses of graphsand is called Graph Travesal

// Traversal algorithms are algorithms used to traverse or visit nodes in a graph

// The main types of traversal algorithms are breadth-first-search and depth-search-first

// The algorithm starts at one node first visits all its neighbours that are one edge away

// Then goes on to visiting each of their neighbors, The point is to determine how close nodes are to a root node
